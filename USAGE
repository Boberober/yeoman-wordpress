Description:
	Yeoman generator to create a wordpress project

    This generator will download Wordpress and a starter theme.
    By default the generator uses the latest stable release of Wordpress
    and the theme _s (https://github.com/automattic/_s) but you can choose
    a different version and theme (as long as you provide a github link for
    the theme)

Example:
	yeoman init yeoman-wordpress

	This will create (simplified):

		.
		|-- .gitattributes
		|-- .gitignore
		|-- Gruntfile.js
		|-- app
		|	// wordpress files
		|	...
		|-- package.json
